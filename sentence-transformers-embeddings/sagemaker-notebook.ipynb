    "## Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we deployed a top open source Embeddings Model (BGE) on a single `inf2.xlarge` instance costing $0.99/hour on Amazon SageMaker using Optimum Neuron. We are able to run 2 replicas of the model on a single instance with a avg. model latency of 11.1-11.5ms for inputs of 300 tokens with a max sequence length of 384 and a throughput without network overhead of 180 inferences per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we can create (300 tokens * 153 requests) 45,900 tokens per second, 2,754,000 tokens per minute and 165,240,000 tokens per hour. This leads to a cost of `~$0.006 1M/tokens` if utilized well. For comparison OpenAI or Amazon Bedrock charges $0.10 per 1M tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "For startups and companies looking into GPU alternative for generating emebddings Inferentia2 is a great option for not only efficient and fast but also cost-effective inference."
