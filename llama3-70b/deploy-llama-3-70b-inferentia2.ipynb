    "[Llama 3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct) is the latest iteration of the open-access Llama family. Llama 3 comes in two sizes: 8B for efficient deployment and development on consumer-size GPU, and 70B for large-scale AI native applications. Both come in base and instruction-tuned variants. In addition to the 4 models, a new version of Llama Guard was fine-tuned on Llama 3 8B and is released as Llama Guard 2 (safety fine-tune).\n",

The benchmark is not a full representation of the model performance, but it gives you a first good indication. If you plan to use the model in production, we recommend to run a longer and closer to your production benchmark, modify the number of replicas see ([Scale LLM Inference on Amazon SageMaker with Multi-Replica Endpoints](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-multi-replicahttps://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-multi-replica)) and most importantly test the model with your own data."
